# Zero-Player Strategic Console Game

## Summary

This project is a console-based strategic game developed as part of a university Data Structures course. The game autonomously simulates battles between castles, using advanced data structures to manage game states and decision-making processes. The key objective is to demonstrate the practical application of data structures like AVL Trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs), and Queues in a game development context.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Gameplay**: The game runs independently without player input, making strategic decisions based on the current game state.
- **Data Structures Utilized**:
  - **AVL Tree**: Maintains a balanced and efficient structure for managing game entities like castles and soldiers.
  - **QueueLL**: A linked-list-based queue for managing in-game tasks and event sequencing.
  - **BST**: Used for basic management of game-related entities.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the use of data structures in a strategic game, highlighting their importance in managing complex, dynamic systems efficiently. It serves as a comprehensive example of applying theoretical knowledge from the Data Structures course to a practical and engaging context.
